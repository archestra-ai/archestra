(version 1)
(allow default)

;; This profile allows everything for now but documents what should be restricted later
;; When we move to a more restrictive profile, we should:
;; 1. Allow only specific Node.js/npm/npx paths (detected at runtime)
;; 2. Restrict file system access to specific directories
;; 3. Allow network access only for npm registry
;; 4. Restrict process execution to only necessary binaries
