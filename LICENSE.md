# A Note from Archestra Inc

Hello, and thank you for your interest in our project!

Please be aware that this is a **temporary license** while Archestra Inc. determines its long-term open-source licensing strategy. We are currently in the early stages of this project and have chosen a very restrictive license to protect it during this formative period.

Our full intention is to move to a standard, permissive open-source license that the community will appreciate and enjoyâ€”something we believe will foster collaboration and growth. We just need a little more time to get everything in order.

We appreciate your understanding and ask for your patience as we work through this process. Thank you!
